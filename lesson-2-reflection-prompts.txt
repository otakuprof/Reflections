1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

a hidden .git directory is created. this is to keep the data that tracks the changes. 



2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?



Its a place to specify exactly what changes you want to commit, before you actually commit it to the repository. 


3) How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical 
change?



Use the staging area as a place to add changes and finally commit when the logical change is done

4) What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?



E.g. when I have different versions of the same project e.g. a working one and an experimental one. 
Branches will then help me to keep track of the changes that i make to each version. 


5) How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

SHows which commits belong to which branch, where the common commit is, and how many branches 




6) What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

one single branch
