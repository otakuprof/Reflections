1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

That's probably when I am collaborating with some one else. 

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository? 

hmm, I'm really not sure at this point.
