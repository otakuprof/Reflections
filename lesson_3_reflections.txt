1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

That's probably when I am collaborating with some one else. 

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository? 

hmm, I'm really not sure at this point. 

3) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

fork - a copy of a repo on github, copied from another. I will do this when I don't have permission to modify that repo itself.  

clone - a local copy of a repo on my computer, so that I can make changes on my own computer first. 

branches - a different set of commits. 

4) What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?


I can continue working on the project when I have no internet access. 

5) How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

I would probably be working in the same room at the same time with my collaborators, and then we would set up regular meetings to discuss changes and plan changes carefully. 

It would be easier to discuss face to face and clarify doubts straightaway. 
It would be harder to see changes made without a tool like GitHub. 
It would also be harder to schedule a common time to work together.

6) When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

Separate branch - when I am collaborating with someone else and I'm not sure if the changes would be accepted by my collaborators.

Directly in master - small changes.
