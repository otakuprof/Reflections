1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

That's probably when I am collaborating with some one else. 

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository? 

hmm, I'm really not sure at this point. 

3) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

fork - a copy of a repo on github, copied from another. I will do this when I don't have permission to modify that repo itself.  

clone - a local copy of a repo on my computer, so that I can make changes on my own computer first. 

branches - a different set of commits. 

4) What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?


I can continue working on the project when I have no internet access.
